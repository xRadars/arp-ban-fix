ARP Ban Fix (archive, original by racecar / dyhis idk who)
Note: idk who made it it was either racecar or dyhis lol
This is a simple batch file which disables IPV6 and other internet settings to reduce the possibility of network flags and solve "arp bans" (people call them that but atleast for FN they dont fucking exist its just retards not disabling IPv6 lol)

# credit to racecar and dyhis and whoever they pasted from
