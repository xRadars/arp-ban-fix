ARP Ban Fix (archive, original by racecar i think)
Note: idk who made it i think it was racecar
This is a simple batch file which disables IPV6 and other internet settings to reduce the possibility of network flags and solve "arp bans" (people call them that but atleast for FN they dont fucking exist its just retards not disabling IPv6 lol)
